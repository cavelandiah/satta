### Hi there 👋

I used to write software that munges DNA sequences 🧬 and their annotations. Now I write software that munges packets 📦 and their annotations. And, if all goes well, I also make sure that everything ends up in [Debian 🍥](https://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=satta).

Check out the stuff I have been working on below.
